								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>Price increase on food, transportation, rent, and other living costs are inevitable. However, it is hard for citizens to keep up with these increases when the same isn't happening to their income. This research aims investigate whether there is injustice in our economic state.</p>

						<h2>We used data from the Philippine Statistics Authority.</h2>
						<p>In this research, we define cost of living as the amount of money a person needs to spend to cover basic expenses such as housing and food. For this data, we used the Poverty Threshold data from the 2009, 2018, and 2021 editions of the Official Poverty Statistics of the Philippines from the Philippine Statistics authority (PSA). Since the full year data for 2023 is not yet currently available, and the Family Income and Expenditure Survey, which is the survey used to obtain data for the Official Poverty Statistics, is only done every three years, the 2021 data is the most recent data available. The PSA defines poverty threshold as the monthly minimum income reqiured for a family/individual to meet the basic food and non-food requirements which fits our definition for cost of living. In addition to this, we also considered the food threshold data which is the minimum income required for a family/individual to meet the basic food needs. <br>
						For the minimum wage, we used the summary of daily minimum non-agriculture wage rates per wage order by region from the National Wages and Productivvity Commission of the Department of Labor and Employment. We will then be multiplying these values by 293, which is the number of ordinary working days according to the Handbook of Workers' Statutory Benefits 2023 edition by the Department of Labor and Employment Bureau of Working Conditions, and divided by 12 months to get the Estimated Equivalent Monthly Rate of minimum wage earners.</p>

								<p>	In order to make our data consistend, we did some scaling on the poverty and food threshold. Instead of using the data directly from PSA, which was in pesos per month,we divided it by 30 to make it per day. This would match our mimimum wage data, which is also per day. In addition to this, since our minimum wage data is taken per region, we took the average of the poverty threshold of each provinces per region. This gave us a poverty threshold per region that we can compare with the minimum wage. </p>

								Linear regression is used to get the slope of the poverty threshold and minimim wage through the years. The z-test is then used to test the equality of the two regressions. The z-score from the z-test is 22.9608 which indicates a very strong deviation from the null hypothesis; and the p-value is extremely small, indicating that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true. </p>

						<h2>Here's what we found out.</h2>
					</header>
						<h3>Results</h3>
						<p>
							The z-score of approximately 21.9608 is extremely high. This tells us the regression slopes of minimum wage and poverty threshold has a substantial difference. <br>

							The p-value of approximately 3.4126x10<sup>-107</sup> is extremely small. This tells us the the probability of observing the result under the null hypothesis is extremely low and that there is great significance in their observed difference. <br>
							
							Because of this, the null hypothesis is rejected. The alternative hypothesis- The minimum wage is not enough to cover the cost of living in the Philippines, is taken to be true due to the values of the cost of living being extremely greater than that of the minimum wage.
